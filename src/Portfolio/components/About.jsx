          Hi, I'm John Doe, a passionate software engineer with a year of
          professional experience. I specialize in front-end development with a
          focus on creating user-friendly and efficient applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My skills include working with technologies like React, JavaScript,
          HTML, and CSS. I enjoy learning new things, solving problems, and
          delivering high-quality code.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
          reading books, or enjoying outdoor activities.
